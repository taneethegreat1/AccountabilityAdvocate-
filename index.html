      <h2>About Tanee L. Elston and the Story Behind Accountability Advocate</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Tanee L. Elston, a seasoned media executive turned advocate for justice and accountability. 
        After dedicating over 25 years to the media industry, I reached a breaking point, witnessing the lack of upward mobility 
        and diversity in leadership roles. This glaring inequity inspired me to walk away from the corporate world and chart a new path—one focused on changing the very systems that hold people back.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal journey hasn’t been without its challenges. As someone who faced workplace abuse and inequity, I understand the pain, frustration, and resilience it takes to fight for justice. 
        These experiences shaped my mission: to create platforms where individuals feel seen, heard, and empowered to demand change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Accountability Advocate educational series was born out of this purpose. It’s more than a platform; it’s a movement. Through this series, I aim to share practical tools, resources, 
        and real-life stories that inspire action and foster understanding. Whether it’s exposing systemic issues, teaching workers their rights, or advocating for policy change, 
        this series is my commitment to building a future where accountability isn’t optional—it’s expected.

  <section class="why-this-matters" id="why">
    <h2>Why This Series Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Workplace abuse, inequity, and systemic injustices aren’t isolated incidents—they’re pervasive issues that impact millions. Yet, many people don’t know where to turn or how to fight back. 
      Accountability Advocate bridges that gap, offering education, hope, and empowerment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Knowledge is Power:</strong> Many workers are unaware of their rights or how to address mistreatment. This series educates and equips them with the tools they need to advocate for themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Amplifying Voices:</strong> By sharing stories, we spotlight the challenges workers face and call attention to the need for systemic reform.</li>
      <li><strong>Driving Change:</strong> Education and awareness are the first steps toward lasting change in workplaces and communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Together, we can dismantle the barriers that keep so many from thriving. The Accountability Advocate is here to inspire action, one story at a time.
